# PhishGuard ðŸš¨

**Code Without Limits: Real-Time Phishing Detection**

PhishGuard is an AI-powered web application that detects phishing websites using **URL-based features** and **screenshot analysis**. The system combines traditional machine learning (Random Forest) and deep learning (CNN) to enhance phishing detection accuracy.

## Features
- **URL-Based Detection:** Uses 31 features extracted from URLs to predict phishing (Random Forest).  
- **Screenshot-Based Detection:** Classifies website screenshots as safe or phishing using CNN.  
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Web frontend for entering features or uploading screenshots.  
- **REST API:** Flask backend with `/predict_url` and `/predict_screenshot` endpoints.  
- **Cross-Platform Deployment:** Can be hosted online on Replit, Heroku, or any cloud service.

## Usage

### URL-Based Detection

Send a POST request to `/predict_url` with JSON:

```json
{
  "features": [1,0,1,1,0,1,...]  // 31 features
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "prediction": 1
}
```

* `1` â†’ Phishing
* `0` â†’ Safe

### Screenshot-Based Detection

Send a POST request to `/predict_screenshot` with form-data containing the screenshot file.
Response:

```json
{
  "prediction": 0
}
```

* `1` â†’ Phishing
* `0` â†’ Safe
